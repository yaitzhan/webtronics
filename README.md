  <summary>Functional requirements</summary>

 - There should be some form of authentication and registration (JWT, Oauth, Oauth 2.0, etc..)
 - As a user I need to be able to signup and login
 - As a user I need to be able to create, edit, delete and view posts
 - As a user I can like or dislike other usersâ€™ posts but not my own 
 - The API needs a UI Documentation (Swagger/ReDoc)

 - Use https://clearbit.com/platform/enrichment for getting additional data for the user on signup

(As a cache, that gets updated whenever new likes and dislikes get added)
